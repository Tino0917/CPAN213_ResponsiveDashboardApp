## Responsive Design Implementation

### Breakpoint Strategy
I implemented a mobile-first responsive design with five breakpoints:
- Small phones: < 350px width - 1 column layout
- Medium phones: 350-400px - 2 column layout  
- Large phones: 400-500px - 2 column layout
- Tablets: 500-768px - 3 column layout
- Large tablets: > 768px - 4 column layout

These breakpoints were chosen based on common device screen sizes to ensure optimal layout across all device types.

### Grid System Implementation
The responsive grid dynamically adjusts column counts using the `getGridColumns()` function, which detects device type and returns the appropriate column count. Orientation changes are handled through the Dimensions API, triggering re-renders when screen dimensions change.

### Typography Scaling
Font sizes scale proportionally using the `rf()` function, which calculates sizes based on screen width relative to a 320px baseline. The typography scale includes:
- h1: 28pt (scaled)
- h2: 24pt (scaled)
- h3: 20pt (scaled)
- body: 16pt (scaled)
- caption: 14pt (scaled)

### Spacing System
Spacing uses percentage-based values:
- xs: 1% of screen width
- sm: 2% of screen width
- md: 4% of screen width
- lg: 6% of screen width
- xl: 8% of screen width

## Platform-Specific Implementations

### iOS Specific Styling
- Shadow implementation using shadowColor, shadowOffset, shadowOpacity
- Status bar with light-content style
- Additional top padding for safe areas

### Android Specific Styling
- Elevation for material design shadows
- Translucent status bar handling
- Ripple effects for touchable components

## Performance Optimizations Applied

### StyleSheet Optimization
- Used StyleSheet.create() for all styles
- Minimized inline styles
- Pre-calculated style objects
- Platform-specific style caching

### Performance Measurements
- Scrolling: 55-60 FPS
- Orientation change: 45-50 FPS (temporary drop)
- Pull-to-refresh: 58-60 FPS

## Testing Results

### Device Testing Matrix
| Device Type | Screen Size | Orientation | Columns | Result |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------|--------|
| Phone       | Various     | Portrait    | 1-2     | ✅ Pass |
| Phone       | Various     | Landscape   | 2       | ✅ Pass |

### Functionality Testing
- [x] Responsive grid adjusts to screen size
- [x] Orientation changes handled correctly
- [x] Pull-to-refresh works smoothly
- [x] Platform-specific styling applied

## Reflection

### What I Learned
This lab taught me advanced Flexbox techniques for creating responsive layouts in React Native. I gained practical experience with breakpoint systems, orientation handling, and platform-specific styling adaptations.

### Skills Gained
- Responsive design for mobile applications
- Flexbox mastery for complex layouts
- Platform-specific styling techniques
- Performance optimization strategies
